## Introduction

This repository contains exercises related to unit testing in JavaScript. Unit testing is a crucial practice in software development that involves testing individual components of a program in isolation. By writing unit tests, you can ensure that your code functions as expected, catch errors early in the development process, and improve code quality and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

Before starting these exercises, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
- A basic understanding of JavaScript syntax and concepts.
- - Familiarity with testing concepts (e.g., test cases, assertions, test suites).
